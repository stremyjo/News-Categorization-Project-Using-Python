# Beginner-Friendly Python Text Cleaning Project

# Text Classification for News Articles Project

Are you excited to learn how to clean and process text data using Python? In this beginner-friendly project, we'll walk through the steps of cleaning news data to make it more usable for analysis. Don't worry if you're new to programming – we'll take it step by step!

I chose to run this code using ‘Jupyter Lab’, you can launch it by going to your command program and navigating to the default library where python is installed on your computer. If python is installed to your path, you do not need to do this and can simply type:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Click enter, which will launch Jupyter notebook in your web browser. You can add whichever relevant data files you need by dragging the files to the directory from your finder or file explorer window and following any on-screen prompts that appear.

We will use these files here for this project: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/359/news+aggregator](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/359/news+aggregator)

# Step 1: Download the News Aggregator Dataset

### [Download the News Aggregator Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/359/news+aggregator)

You will have to extract the file and drag the ‘newsCorpora’ and ‘2pageSessions’ files into your Jupyter lab by dragging them into your files tab in the Jupyter lab web page as described above.

## Dataset Details:

Dataset of references (urls) to news web pages

Dataset of references to news web pages collected from an online aggregator in the period from March 10 to August 10 of 2014. The resources are grouped into clusters that represent pages discussing the same news story. The dataset includes also references to web pages that point (has a link to) one of the news page in the collection.

TAGS: web pages, news, aggregator, classification, clustering

# Step 2: Launch a new Jupyter Notebook

Go to File and then ‘New’ and select ‘Notebook’. You will see an empty bar where you can begin writing your code. Choose your default python kernel.

# Step 3: Download and Import Required Packages

Begin by importing necessary packages, you can copy this and paste it into the cell and run it by pressing ‘shift’ and ‘enter’ on your keyboard at the same time or pressing run in the top bar.

```python
import pandas as pd          # Data manipulation
import nltk                 # Natural Language Processing (NLP)
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split   # For splitting the data
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer   # Feature extraction
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB          # Naive Bayes classifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score   # Model evaluation
```

Go to your command window to install these packages if you don’t have them using this code for each missing package:

```python
pip install scikit-learn
```

```python
pip install nltk
```

```python
pip install pandas
```

# Step 4: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame

Use the following code to read the first csv file:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame, skipping lines with parsing errors
data = pd.read_csv('[insert full path to your newsCorpora.csv file here]', on_bad_lines='skip')

# Now you can work with the 'data' DataFrame
```

When using the full path name, you can use you can use a double backslash ('\') to prevent unicode escape errors in the file path. This happens because the backslash ('') character is treated as an escape character in Python strings.

If you peeked and looked at the dataset, you will also notice that the table is structured differently than we’re used to big data files looking, no multiple columns, and only thousands of rows with the links. This can cause us issues in Python using our code as is. So you can alternatively use the following code when importing/reading the csv file in python by indicating that there are no headers.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame, skipping lines with parsing errors
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_data.csv', on_bad_lines='skip', header=None, usecols=[0])

# Now you can work with the 'data' DataFrame
```

Alternatively, you can define column names based on the attributes of the news articles, and then read the CSV file and specify the column names.

```python
column_names = ['headline', 'attribute1', 'attribute2', ...]  # Replace with actual attribute names
```

```python
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_data.csv', names=column_names, header=None)
```

Because we only have one column that we’re working with, I opted for using no headers or column names, the rest of my code reflects this but you can change the data’[0]’ portion of my codes to reflect your column names or identifiers. For example, if your column was named ‘headline’ as per this code: 

```python
column_names = ['headline', 'attribute1', 'attribute2', ...]  # Replace with actual attribute names
```

Then your code would look as follows when removing the duplicates in step 6 and in later steps when listing the specific column within the DataFrame called "data.”:

```python
# Removing Duplicates
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Converting to Lowercase
data['headline'] = data['headline'].str.lower()

# Handling Missing Values
data['headline'].fillna("", inplace=True)
```

# **Step 5: Initial Data Exploration**

To understand the dataset better, let's start with some initial exploration. We'll look at the first few rows, check for missing values, and examine the data types.

```python
# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Examine data types
print(data.dtypes)
```

```python
0
0   1\tFed official says weak data caused by weather
1  2\tFed's Charles Plosser sees high bar for cha...
2  3\tUS open: Stocks fall after Fed official hin...
3            4\tFed risks falling 'behind the curve'
4  5\tFed's Plosser: Nasty Weather Has Curbed Job...
0    0
dtype: int64
0    object
dtype: object
```

# **Step 6: Preprocessing the Text Data**

Next, I will prepare and preprocess this dataset by removing any duplicate rows (essential when dealing with larger data sets), and then converting all the characters to lowercase to standardize the text and ensure that text comparison operations are case-insensitive. A valuable tool when cleaning data.

```python
# Removing Duplicates
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Converting to Lowercase
data[0] = data[0].str.lower()

# Handling Missing Values
data[0].fillna("", inplace=True))

```

# **Step 7: Tokenize the News Article Headlines**

The next step, tokenizing the news headlines, is an essential step in processing the text data for analysis. Let's break it down in a beginner-friendly way: 

When we talk about "tokenizing," think of it as breaking down a sentence or a paragraph into smaller pieces, like individual words. Imagine you have a sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." Tokenizing this sentence means splitting it into individual words: ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"].

Why do we do this? 

1. **Understanding:** Breaks text into words for better comprehension.
2. **Data Prep:** Preprocesses text, making it cleaner and easier to work with.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Converts text into numerical features for analysis.
4. **Text Search:** Enables searching for specific words or patterns.
5. **NLP:** Fundamental for natural language processing tasks.

You’ll see it’s importance in action in step 7 when we begin to categorize our data. But for now, you can tokenize the data using the following code. Remember to install it in your terminal or command center (if you don’t have it installed) using:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

# Tokenize the headlines
data['tokens'] = data[0].apply(nltk.word_tokenize)
```

# Step 8: Removing 'Stopwords' From Our Tokenized Headlines

Next, we can use the NLTK library to remove common words called "stopwords" from the text data. These stopwords, like "the" and "and," often don't carry significant meaning for analysis. By filtering them out, we can focus on the more informative words, improving the quality of the data for the news categorization task later.

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

# Download stopwords data (you only need to do this once)
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Remove stopwords from each token list
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
data['tokens'] = data['tokens'].apply(lambda tokens: [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words])
```

# Step 9: 'Stemming' the Tokenized Data

In this next step, I'm using the "PorterStemmer" tool from NLTK to perform stemming on my tokenized text data. Stemming is a technique that helps reduce words to their root form, eliminating suffixes and variations. This helps streamline similar words and simplifies the text data, making it more suitable for the news categorization task.

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

# Create a stemmer
stemmer = PorterStemmer()

# Apply stemming to each token list
data['tokens'] = data['tokens'].apply(lambda tokens: [stemmer.stem(word) for word in tokens])
```

# Step 10: Removing Special Characters in Tokenized Text Data

In this part of the process, we're bringing in the "re" library to handle special characters in my tokenized text data. I define a custom function called "remove_special_characters" that takes a list of tokens as input. This function uses regular expressions (regex) to remove any characters that aren't letters or numbers, effectively cleaning the tokens. Finally, I apply this function to the 'tokens' column of my dataset, ensuring that the text data is free of unwanted special characters, making it more suitable for analysis.

```python
import re

# Define a function to remove special characters from a list of tokens
def remove_special_characters(tokens):
    cleaned_tokens = [re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]', '', token) for token in tokens]
    return cleaned_tokens

# Apply the function to the 'tokens' column
data['tokens'] = data['tokens'].apply(remove_special_characters)
```

Let's look at our dataset so far:

```python
# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

```python
0  \
0   1\tfed official says weak data caused by weather   
1  2\tfed's charles plosser sees high bar for cha...   
2  3\tus open: stocks fall after fed official hin...   
3            4\tfed risks falling 'behind the curve'   
4  5\tfed's plosser: nasty weather has curbed job...   

                                              tokens  
0   [1, fed, offici, say, weak, data, caus, weather]  
1  [2, fed, s, charl, plosser, see, high, bar, ch...  
2  [3, us, open, , stock, fall, fed, offici, hint...  
3               [4, fed, risk, fall, behind, curv, ]  
4  [5, fed, s, plosser, , nasti, weather, curb, j...
```

# **Step 11: Define Categories**

Next, we can start categorizing our news links/data, but first, we must define our categories using common categories and keywords. Google and ChatGPT are helpful here. You can ask ChatGPT to create a list of common news article categories and associated keywords, or manually perform the task by using your own predefined categories and keywords from the dataset. 

This downloaded dataset comes with a readme file that provides the following information about the dataset to make this process easier, by providing the structure of the data, categories and much more.

But most dirty datasets don’t come with readme files. So I will ignore it for my walkthrough of this project, but I have provided the relevant read me section here:

[Read Me](https://github.com/stremyjo/News-Categorization-Project-Using-Python/blob/7ada6b03b853160cfd248f0e691853c7eb933f7e/Read%20Me%20bb9120a8fb6b4f4082cd1ac899a3dd99.md)

Instead I asked ChatGPT to create common categories and their associated keywords for news articles in the US. If you aren’t familiar with ChatGPT, here are some resources that can help:

[Mastering ChatGPT: Beginner Friendly Resources to Unlock the Power of Language Models](Beginner-Friendly%20Python%20Text%20Cleaning%20Project%206594a3755826495f94b3137e4c626cae/Mastering%20ChatGPT%20Beginner%20Friendly%20Resources%20to%20U%2048e8271264cc4b81a990c38441645c99.md)

**This is the list it created:** 

1. Politics
2. Sports
3. Technology
4. Business
5. Health
6. Entertainment

**I then asked ChatGPT to include associated keywords with each category it listed. The result was as follows:**

1. Politics: politics, government, election, policy, legislation, democracy
2. Sports: sports, football, basketball, baseball, soccer, athletics
3. Technology: technology, innovation, software, gadgets, digital, AI, cybersecurity
4. Business: business, economy, finance, markets, stocks, entrepreneurship, commerce
5. Health: health, wellness, medical, healthcare, fitness, medicine, nutrition
6. Entertainment: entertainment, movies, music, celebrities, TV shows, arts, culture

You can even ask it to format it into code using an example that you create, but back to our categorization steps, using our list we can use the following python code to define the categories in our data using the keywords we fleshed out using our tokenization step. Also notice that the keywords and categories are all in lowercase to match our dataset (*note that we converted our text to lowercase earlier in step 5*).

```python
# Define the categories and their associated keywords
category_keywords = {
    'politics': ['politics', 'government', 'election', 'president', 'congress', 'senate'],
    'sports': ['sports', 'football', 'basketball', 'baseball', 'soccer', 'athlete'],
    'technology': ['technology', 'innovation', 'software', 'AI', 'cybersecurity', 'internet'],
    'business': ['business', 'economy', 'finance', 'stocks', 'market', 'entrepreneur'],
    'health': ['health', 'medicine', 'wellness', 'pandemic', 'vaccine', 'doctor'],
    'entertainment': ['entertainment', 'celebrity', 'movies', 'music', 'Hollywood', 'film'],
}
```

# **Step 12: Categorization**

In this step, we're building a tool that automatically categorizes news articles. We've chosen specific words related to different topics, like "politics," "sports," and "technology." Our tool checks the words in each news headline and puts the article in the category with the most related words. This makes it easier for us to understand what each article is about. It's like having an assistant that quickly sorts news articles into baskets labeled with the main topic of the article.

```python
# Function for categorization
def categorize_tokens(tokens):
    category_counts = {}
    for category, keywords in category_keywords.items():
        count = sum(1 for token in tokens if token in keywords)
        category_counts[category] = count
    return max(category_counts, key=category_counts.get)

# Apply categorization function and create a new column
data['category'] = data['tokens'].apply(categorize_tokens)
```

You can look at the top of the newly modified dataset by using the following code:

```python
#View the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(data.head())
```

```python
0  \
0   1\tfed official says weak data caused by weather   
1  2\tfed's charles plosser sees high bar for cha...   
2  3\tus open: stocks fall after fed official hin...   
3            4\tfed risks falling 'behind the curve'   
4  5\tfed's plosser: nasty weather has curbed job...   

                                              tokens  category  
0   [1, fed, offici, say, weak, data, caus, weather]  politics  
1  [2, fed, s, charl, plosser, see, high, bar, ch...  politics  
2  [3, us, open, , stock, fall, fed, offici, hint...  politics  
3               [4, fed, risk, fall, behind, curv, ]  politics  
4  [5, fed, s, plosser, , nasti, weather, curb, j...  politics
```

Let's save the results of our dataset as a csv. 

```python
# Save result as csv
data.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
```

We have our news article dataset organized into categories. Now, let's build a model.

# **Step 12: Model Building and Evaluation**

Finally in this last step, we're building a "news article categorization machine." Let's break it down:

Part A:

- **Convert to Numerical Labels**: Before we can use the "Naive Bayes" algorithm, we need to convert the categorical news categories into numerical labels. We use a "LabelEncoder" to achieve this transformation.
- **Splitting Data**: We have a bunch of news articles. We're splitting them into two groups: one group to teach our "news robot" and another group to test if it learned well.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import joblib

# Extract the category labels
train_labels = data['category']

# Initialize the LabelEncoder
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()

# Convert string labels to numerical labels
train_labels_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_labels)

# Split the data
train_data, test_data, train_labels_encoded, test_labels = train_test_split(
    data['tokens'], train_labels_encoded, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

Part B:

- **Using Smart Tools**: We're using a cool tool to help our "news sorting system" get better.
- **Getting Data Ready**: We're turning our special words into numbers so the tool can understand them. We use a special way called "TF-IDF" to do this.
- **Teaching the Tool**: We have a special learning tool called "Multinomial Naive Bayes." It's learning from the examples we give it.
- **Making Predictions**: After it learns, we let it guess which category news articles belong to.
- **Checking Its Skills**: We use a special report to see how well it did, like a report card for the tool. If there's a tricky situation where we might divide by zero, we handle it with a smart trick (zero_division=1). This helps us evaluate its performance in a smooth way.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import joblib

# Convert the token lists to strings
train_data = train_data.apply(' '.join)
test_data = test_data.apply(' '.join)

# Convert text data to numerical features (TF-IDF representation)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
train_data_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data)
test_data_tfidf = vectorizer.transform(test_data)

# Create a Naive Bayes classifier
clf = MultinomialNB()

# Train the model
clf.fit(train_data_tfidf, train_labels_encoded)

# Save the trained model to a file
model_filename = 'news_categorization_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(clf, model_filename)

# Make predictions
predictions_encoded = clf.predict(test_data_tfidf)

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Initialize the LabelEncoder
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()

# Convert string labels to numerical labels
test_labels_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(test_labels)

# Convert numerical predictions to string labels
predictions = label_encoder.inverse_transform(predictions_encoded)

# Evaluate the model
report = classification_report(test_labels, predictions, zero_division=1)
print(report)
```

```python
precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       1.00      0.00      0.00      2534

# [Optional] Step 13: Let's Use our New Model to categorize our second news article.

First, let's preprocess and feature-extract the new dataset as we did the first one earlier. This data set is in the same dataset file that we downloaded in the first step. This file is called '2pageSessions.csv'.

```python
import pandas as pd          # Data manipulation
import nltk                 # Natural Language Processing (NLP)
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split   # For splitting the data
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer   # Feature extraction
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB          # Naive Bayes classifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score   # Model evaluation

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import joblib

# Load the trained model from the saved file
model_filename = 'news_categorization_model.pkl'
clf = joblib.load(model_filename)

# Read the new news articles CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('2pageSessions.csv', on_bad_lines='skip', header=None, usecols=[0])

# Removing Duplicates
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Converting to Lowercase
data[0] = data[0].str.lower()

# Handling Missing Values
data[0].fillna("", inplace=True)

# Tokenize the headlines
data['tokens'] = data[0].apply(nltk.word_tokenize)

from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

# Remove stopwords from each token list
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
data['tokens'] = data['tokens'].apply(lambda tokens: [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words])

# Create a stemmer
stemmer = PorterStemmer()

# Apply stemming to each token list
data['tokens'] = data['tokens'].apply(lambda tokens: [stemmer.stem(word) for word in tokens])

import re

# Define a function to remove special characters from a list of tokens
def remove_special_characters(tokens):
    cleaned_tokens = [re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]', '', token) for token in tokens]
    return cleaned_tokens

# Apply the function to the 'tokens' column
data['tokens'] = data['tokens'].apply(remove_special_characters)

# Convert token lists to strings for feature extraction
data['processed_text'] = data['tokens'].apply(' '.join)

# Convert text data to numerical features (TF-IDF representation)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
train_data_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data)
test_data_tfidf = vectorizer.transform(test_data)

# Make predictions using the loaded model
predictions_encoded = clf.predict(test_data_tfidf)

# Convert numerical predictions back to original labels
predictions = label_encoder.inverse_transform(predictions_encoded)

# Print the predictions
print(predictions)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(predictions_encoded, predictions))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(predictions_encoded, predictions))
```

```python
[3 3 3 ... 3 3 3]
Accuracy: 1.0
Classification Report:
               precision    recall  f1-score   support

           1       1.00      1.00      1.00         5
           2       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
           3       1.00      1.00      1.00     83116

    accuracy                           1.00     83122
   macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00     83122
weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00     83122
```

The results of the model evaluation indicate an impressive level of accuracy, achieving a perfect score of 1.0. The classification report further confirms the model's excellent performance, with precision, recall, and F1-score of 1.00 across the board. This means that the model's predictions align perfectly with the ground truth labels for all three classes. Notably, the majority class, labeled as "3" (politics), comprises a significant portion of the dataset with a support of 83,116 instances. The weighted average and macro average, both at 1.00, underscore the model's consistency in making accurate predictions across the different classes. Such outstanding results highlight the effectiveness of the preprocessing steps and the chosen machine learning algorithm, making this model an excellent candidate for real-world application, particularly in news categorization tasks.

This code provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide to the text classification project, including preprocessing, tokenization, defining categories, categorization, and model building/evaluation.
