# Detailed explanation of this function if you want to learn more

In this step, we're creating a special function to help us put each news article into the right category. Think of it like sorting different kinds of fruits into their own baskets. We'll look at the words in the news headlines and see which "basket" they belong in based on the words we've chosen.

Here's what our function does:

1. **We Get Ready:** We start by preparing empty "baskets" (in our case, we use a special dictionary called **`category_counts`**).
2. **We Check Each Basket:** We look at each category we've decided on (like "politics," "sports," and "technology") and see if any of the words in the news headline match the keywords we've chosen for that category.
3. **We Count:** For each category, we count how many words in the news headline match the keywords for that category.
4. **We Remember the Count:** We remember the count for each category, like how many words in the news headline matched the "politics" keywords, the "sports" keywords, and so on.
5. **We Decide:** We then decide which "basket" (category) has the most words that match. It's like saying, "This news headline talks about politics the most, so it goes in the 'politics' basket."
6. **We Label the Basket:** Finally, we put a label on the news headline, saying which category it belongs to, and we add this label to a new column in our list of news articles.

So, with this step, we're creating a way to automatically put news articles into categories based on the words they use, making it easier for us to understand what each article is about. It's like having a helper that can quickly sort news articles for us.
